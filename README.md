# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview of Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies Analysis project uses Unsupervised Machine Learning technique to analyze cryptocurrencies dataset. Through unsupervised machine learning, we use K-means model, Elbow Curve, and principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize the results. Our goal is to reduce data dimensions, clustering crytocurrencies, and create a report to predict new investment in the trading market.

## Results
- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Crytocurrencies Using K-Means
- Visualizing Results
